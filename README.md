# Openvino Beginner: Building a Crossroad AI Camera Course Overview

In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

1. Learn to use Images/Video/Camera as inputs, via OpenCV*
2. Learn to create neural network pipelining: Person Attributes and Person Re-identification networks are executed on top of the Person Detection results
3. Learn to create visualization of Person Attributes and Person Re-identification (REID) information for each detected person in an Image/Video/Camera input.

By the end of this course, you will be able to create an inference pipeline for persons' detection, recognition and reidentification in Crossroad Camera systems.

## Tasks
The hands-on project on Building a Crossroad AI Camera is divided into the following tasks:

**Task 1: [OpenVINOâ„¢](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) Toolkit Components**
- Deep Learning Model Optimizer
- Deep Learning Inference Engine 
- Inference Engine Samples 

**Task 2:  Model Downloader**
- Intel Open Model Zoo
- Download pre-trained models using Model Downloader utility
- Post-Training Optimization tool

**Task 3: Model Preparation, Conversion and Optimization**
- Intermediate Representation (IR) 
- Convert Pre-trained Models with Model Optimizer
- Accuracy Checker utility

**Task 4: Running and Tuning Inference**
- Employ the Inference Engine API
- Optimize API calls to OpenCV Library for processing

Task 5: Crossroad Camera Inference
- Create visualization of Person Attributes and Person Re-identification (REID) information for each detected person in an Image/Video/Camera input.
